Problem 1
=========

The chunk below creates a data frame containing a random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution, a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2, a (length-10) character vector, and a (length-10) factor vector.

``` r
# Set seed to ensure reproducibility
set.seed(123)  

# Create a data frame of 4 variables
p1_df = tibble(
  unif_samp = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logical = unif_samp >= 2, 
  vec_char = c("I", "am", "glad", "to", "be", "here", "Wishing", "you", "happiness", "always"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female", "male", "female", "female", "male", "female", "female"))
)
```

Below is the data frame:

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    unif_samp vec_logical vec_char  vec_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>     <fct>     
    ##  1     1.44  FALSE       I         male      
    ##  2     3.94  TRUE        am        male      
    ##  3     2.04  TRUE        glad      female    
    ##  4     4.42  TRUE        to        female    
    ##  5     4.70  TRUE        be        male      
    ##  6     0.228 FALSE       here      female    
    ##  7     2.64  TRUE        Wishing   female    
    ##  8     4.46  TRUE        you       male      
    ##  9     2.76  TRUE        happiness female    
    ## 10     2.28  TRUE        always    female

Take the mean of each variable in the above data frame.

-   The mean of variable `unif_samp` is 2.8912375
-   The mean of variable `vec_logical` is 0.8
-   The mean of variable `vec_char` is NA
-   The mean of variable `vec_factor` is NA

We get the mean of variables `unif_samp` and `vec_logical`, but we does not get the mean of variables `vec_char` and `vec_factor`. That is because we cannot calculate the mean of character and factor variables.

The chunk below applies the `as.numeric` function to the logical, character, and factor variables.

``` r
as.numeric(p1_df$vec_logical)
as.numeric(p1_df$vec_character)
as.numeric(p1_df$vec_factor)
```

The scripts above convert the logical, character, and factor variables from their original types to numeric.

The chunk below converts the character variable from character to factor to numeric; similarly, converts the factor variable from factor to character to numeric.

``` r
# Convert the character variable to facter, then to numeric
as.numeric(factor(p1_df$vec_character))   
```

    ## Warning: Unknown or uninitialised column: 'vec_character'.

    ## numeric(0)

``` r
# Convert the factor variable to character, then to numeric
as.numeric(as.character(p1_df$vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning: 强制改变过程中产生了NA

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

We find that the first conversion succeeds, and outputs a sequence of numbers corresponding to the alphabetical order of the original character variables.

However, the second conversion outputs a sequence of NA values. From this experiment, We learn that character variable cannot be converted from character to numeric directly. It should be first converted to factor, and then to numeric.
